AndroidWearNotifications
========================

This is the WearablesNotificationSample for the Android Wear Preview ported to Android Wear 1.0

This is Eclipse compatible but requires the following jars to be places in the libs folder:

android-support-v4.jar (right click on project -> Android Tools -> Add Support Library...)

androidwear-1.0.0.jar (created manually by extracting classes from the .aar file *)


 *see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24520240/import-android-support-wearable-cannot-be-resolved
 
 Note: this targets API Level 19 instead of 20 as there isn't a Wearable component.
