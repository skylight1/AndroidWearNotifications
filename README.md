AndroidWearNotifications
========================

This is the WearablesNotificationSample for the Android Wear Preview ported to Android Wear 1.0

This is Eclipse compatible but requires the following libs:

android-support-v4.jar

androidwear-1.0.0.jar (created manually by extracting classes from the .aar file *)
