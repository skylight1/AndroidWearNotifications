AndroidWearNotifications
========================

This is the WearablesNotificationSample for the Android Wear Preview ported to Android Wear 1.0

This is an Eclipse compatible but requires the following jars to be places in the libs folder:

android-support-v4.jar (right click on project -> Android Tools -> Add Support Library...)

androidwear-1.0.0.jar (created manually by extracting classes from the .aar file *)


 *see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24520240/import-android-support-wearable-cannot-be-resolved
 
 Note: this targets API Level 19 instead of 20 as there isn't a Wearable component.
 
 Note: this project is an excercise for those who studied the earlier Android Wear Preview APIs
 
 For those just starting out, use the new official SDK sample code.
 
 The official replacement project is available in the SDK samples for API Level 20:
 samples/android-20/wearable/Notifications
 
 Here's what's different (notice new presets and one removed preset the BigActionNotification):
 
 NotificationPresets.java from AndroidWearPreview:
 
     public static final NotificationPreset[] PRESETS = new NotificationPreset[] {
            new BasicNotificationPreset(),
            new InboxNotificationPreset(),
            new BigPictureNotificationPreset(),
            new BigTextNotificationPreset(),
            new BigActionNotificationPreset(),
            new MultiplePageNotificationPreset(),
            new NotificationBundlePreset()
    };
    
Updated NotificationPresets.java from AndroidWear 1.0.0:
 
    public static final NotificationPreset[] PRESETS = new NotificationPreset[] {
            BASIC,
            STYLIZED_TEXT,
            INBOX,
            BIG_PICTURE,
            BIG_TEXT,
            BOTTOM_ALIGNED,
            GRAVITY,
            CONTENT_ACTION,
            CONTENT_ICON,
            MULTIPLE_PAGE,
            BUNDLE
    };

There is also now a Wearable component for the watch (hence target API 20) with the following presets support:

    public static final NotificationPreset[] PRESETS = new NotificationPreset[] {
            new BasicPreset(),
            new StylizedTextPreset(),
            new DisplayIntentPreset(),
            new MultiSizeDisplayIntentPreset(),
            new AnimatedDisplayIntentPreset(),
            new ContentIconPreset()
    };

Note in Eclipse you'll need to do this (you'll have 2 projects) in AS (Android Studio) you don't need to unless you have prepaid apps - the workaround at this time is here:
